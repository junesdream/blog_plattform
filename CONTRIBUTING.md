# Contributing to Blog Platform

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with GitHub
We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [GitHub Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:
1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](LICENSE.md) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issues](https://github.com/your-github-username/blog-platform/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/your-github-username/blog_platform/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code
**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:
- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
    - Be specific!
    - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People *love* thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a consistent and respectful tone when interacting with contributors in issues and PRs. Remember that this is a project we're working on together as a community.

## Pull Request Etiquette
- Create a personal fork of the project on GitHub.
- Clone the fork on your local machine. Your remote repo on Github is called origin.
- Add the original repository as a remote called upstream.
- If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
- Create a new branch to work on! Branch from main.
- Implement/fix your feature, comment your code.
- Follow the code style of the project, including indentation.
- If the project includes tests, write tests that cover your changes.
- Run the tests, ensuring they all pass.
- Write or adapt the documentation as needed.
- Push your branch to your fork on GitHub, the remote origin.
- From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch. Target the project's main branch!
- Once the pull request is approved and merged, you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es).

## And coding style tests
- Ensure your code complies with any code style guidelines/standards specified in the project documentation.
- Use clean, readable syntax and include comments where necessary.

## Community and behavioral expectations
- Respect the time and effort of everyone involved in the project by making clear and concise communications.
- Maintain the integrity of the community by advocating inclusiveness and ensuring a welcoming environment for all participants.

Thank you for your contributions to making this a successful project!
